MILESTONE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to build a static (front-end only) website for a band. The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
In order to achieve these goals I was provided with assets such as photos of the band, a music video, and a number of the band's songs. These are displayed on separate pages within the website.
The band are also in the process of creating a social media presence and so I added links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages in the footer of each individual page.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HML5 - The standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
CSS3 - A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
BOOTSTRAP - A free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications.
Cloud9 - A cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that lets users write, run, and debug code with just a browser.

TESTING

This project was built using the Cloud9 IDE. This platform provides the user with a preview of how their work looks and a function that runs the code in a brower window.
Both of these facilities were used for testing the functionality of the site. Some problems were encountered when using the browser function for testing, changes made to the code did not render in the browser, 
so the preview function was mostly used for testing the code.
