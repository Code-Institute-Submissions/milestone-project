MILESTONE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to build a static (front-end only) website for a band. The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
In order to achieve these goals I was provided with assets such as photos of the band, a music video, and a number of the band's songs. These are displayed on separate pages within the website.
The band are also in the process of creating a social media presence and so I added links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages in the footer of each individual page.
