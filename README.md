MILESTONE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to build a static (front-end only) website for a band. The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
In order to achieve these goals I was provided with assets such as photos of the band, a music video, and a number of the band's songs. These are displayed on separate pages within the website.
The band are also in the process of creating a social media presence and so I added links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages in the footer of each individual page.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HML5 - The standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
CSS3 - A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
BOOTSTRAP - A free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications.
Cloud9 - A cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that lets users write, run, and debug code with just a browser.


TESTING
This project was built using the Cloud9 IDE. This platform provides the user with a preview of how their work looks and a function that runs the code in a brower window.
Both of these facilities were used for testing the functionality of the site. This funtion also allows the user to resize the screen area and by doing this I was able to test how the code rendered on different screen sizes.
As this is a mobile-first development, this function was a crucial part of my testing. When I viewed my project in a separate browser I used the inspect function to achieve the same goal.
Some problems were encountered when using the browser function for testing, changes made to the code did not render in the browser, 
so the preview function was mostly used for testing the code.


FUNCTIONALITY
The header and footer of each page is identical as this maintains the overall consistency of the website. This is a very important factor for creating a good user experience. 
The page headers have an image at the top which links to the index (home) page. Beneath this image there is a menu with three items and each item links to another page of the website.
The page footers contain a bookings section and a social section. The bookings section provides users with another link to the events page and the social section contains links
to the band's social media sites. The home page contains a news section which can be updated to provide new information to users. Within the text there is another link to the events
page and a link to The Monkees wikipedia page where users can learn more about the band if they want to. The music page contains one of the band's music videos and four songs which are audio only.
The events page contains a form which users are invited to fill out in order to book the band for an event. Finally, the gallery contains a band photos section and an album artwork section.
The band photos section contains pictures of the individual band members and photos of the band together. The album artwork section contains a number of the band's album covers.


CODE REUSE
Some code from the resume mini project was reused in the making of this project. For example, the header menu layout was reused but it was changed to make it look more like the style of the band.
The form used in the events page was reused from the contact page of the mini project, with some minor style changes. A simple form was all that was required for the events page and so I thought
it would save time to reuse one I had made earlier.
